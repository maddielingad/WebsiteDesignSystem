# Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System

## Project Goals
In this project, I built my own basic design system for a website. On my site, I collected colors, fonts, and some repeating styles with the goal of helping me build more websites in the future.

## Description
Here, I created a website style guide composed of 5 main sections: colors, fonts, text styles, as well as a header and a footer.

## Project Requirements
1. A labeled section outlining the colors to be used.
   - A name.
   - A box displaying the color itself.
   - The CSS value used to create the color.
   - An optional description of how you intend to use the colors.
3. A labeled section outlining the fonts to be used.
   - The font name.
   - A series of styles that you intend to use.
   - A sentence or series of words to demonstrate the text style.
4. A labeled section outlining the specific text styles for page elements to be used.
   - A page element name.
   - All style rules.
